## Portfolio repo

This is a bespoke portfolio built with Next.js, Tailwind, and smooth scrolling.

### Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

### Quality gates

```bash
# Lint + TypeScript in one go
pnpm check

# Individual commands if you prefer
pnpm lint
pnpm type-check

# Production bundle analysis without lint overhead
pnpm analyze
```

### Showcase code snapshots

The highlights grid is populated from static JSON generated by a small helper script. Because many sources live in private repositories, you need a personal access token with `repo` scope.

1. Create a classic GitHub token with at least `repo` access.
2. Export it before running the fetcher:

	```bash
	export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_yourTokenHere
	pnpm showcase:pull
	```

The script reads `scripts/showcase.config.json`, downloads the referenced files (full file contents), stamps the highlighted line ranges, and writes them into `src/data/showcase.json`. The `Showcase` component simply reads the JSONâ€”no runtime GitHub calls ship to production.

### Build

```bash
pnpm build
```

### Performance + SEO considerations

- Smooth scrolling now respects `prefers-reduced-motion` and lazily loads the smooth-scroll implementation only when needed.
- Heavy highlight code blocks render on demand so the initial bundle stays lean.
- Navigation interactions avoid extra JavaScript dependencies, improving hydration costs.
- Metadata includes canonical URLs, Open Graph/Twitter images, and JSON-LD for richer search snippets.
